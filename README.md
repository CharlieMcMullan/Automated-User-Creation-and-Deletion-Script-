# Automated-User-Creation-and-Deletion-Script-
This is a script run using Python which creates and writes two scripts in Bash. These two scripts are to create or delete users. The users are read in from a file using a specified argument and can generate any number of users. The scripts will give status updates and alert errors. This script was not made for public use and only to develop my skills.
